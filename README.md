## What it is

A small staff expense-claim portal: staff sign in, submit claims, view their own
claims and download receipts. Finance and admin roles exist. It is about the size
of a real internal tool that nobody security-reviewed.

## Running it

```
npm install
npm run seed            # creates expenses.db and sample receipts
npm start               # http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Sample accounts (the passwords are weak on purpose):

| Username | Password     | Role    |
| -------- | ------------ | ------- |
| `jdoe`   | `password1`  | staff   |
| `rsmith` | `letmein`    | staff   |
| `achen`  | `Summer2026` | finance |
| `admin`  | `admin`      | admin   |

## Your task

The brief is the authority — this file only tells you how to run the thing. In
summary you must identify **at least six distinct security vulnerabilities**,
demonstrate each one, classify it, assess its impact, and fix it.

Two things students routinely lose marks on:

- **Six distinct vulnerabilities, not six instances of one.** Three injectable
  parameters in the same query pattern is one vulnerability found three times.
- **A proof-of-concept is required.** "This looks vulnerable to X" scores far
  below a request, a response and a screenshot showing X actually happening.

## Rules of engagement

Test **only** this application, **only** on your own machine, **only** on
localhost. Nothing here authorises you to test any CCT system, any third-party
site, or anything else. Doing so is a disciplinary matter and, under the Criminal
Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017, potentially a
criminal one.

## Declaring AI use

The AI Fluency declaration table in the brief is compulsory. Using a tool to help
find or explain a vulnerability is permitted; not declaring it is not.
